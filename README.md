* Significant overlap - significant.
* Mild overlap - mild.
* Same subsumed by Not Same - sub.

Execute both script.py and scriptv2.py inorder to generate results for all parameters.
Results will be stored in 'new results' and 'large' folders.
Execute the python dictionaries 'process-small' and 'process-large' to generate graphs and table values.
